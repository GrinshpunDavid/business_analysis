## Project description:
Iâ€™ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. 
The project is promising but expensive, so I need to attract investors.

### Goal:
Understand if in the current market conditions, will we be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?

### Data description:
- Establishment name
- Chain
- Establishment type
- Address
- Number of seats

### Steps performed:
- EDA
- Determine the average number of seats for each type of restaurant
- Find the distribution of the number of seats in popular streets
- Determine what should be the number of seats of our robot cafe.

### Results:
- Best street to open new cafe: Sunset Boulevard.
- Optimal number of seats is between 14 and 29.
